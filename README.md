## Projects
### [Project 1: SR.Python developer]
- In my current role at Truist Bank, I’m working on a project focused on enhancing the bank's data processing and reporting capabilities. Here’s a brief overview:
Project Overview:
The primary objective of this project is to rewrite existing Java applications into Python modules to streamline data processing and improve performance. We’re also developing a series of web applications using the Django framework to facilitate better user interactions and reporting.
Key Responsibilities:
1.	Application Migration: I lead the effort to convert legacy Java applications into Python, ensuring that the new modules deliver the same functionality while improving maintainability and scalability.
2.	API Development: I am responsible for designing and implementing RESTful APIs using Django Rest Framework. These APIs allow different components of our system to communicate effectively and provide real-time data access.
3.	Data Processing: I’ve developed Python batch processors that consume and produce various data feeds, utilizing libraries like Pandas and PySpark to handle large datasets efficiently.
4.	Containerization: We’re using Docker to containerize our applications, which simplifies deployment and scaling. I’ve set up a CI/CD pipeline with Jenkins to automate testing and deployment processes, ensuring consistent delivery of updates.
5.	Collaboration and Training: I conduct training sessions for team members on utilizing Python for data analysis and integrating it with tools like Excel. Collaboration is key, and I actively participate in code reviews to ensure adherence to coding standards.
Technologies Used:
•	Languages: Python, SQL
•	Frameworks: Django, Django Rest Framework
•	Tools: Docker, Jenkins, Git, PySpark
•	Databases: MySQL, PostgreSQL
•	Cloud Services: AWS for hosting and data storage


### [Project 2: Early Warning]
In my previous role at Early Warning, I contributed to developing and maintaining a range of data-driven solutions, primarily using Python and Django. I worked closely with teams to create ETL pipelines, integrate machine learning models, and develop real-time data dashboards. My responsibilities included automating tasks with Python, building deep learning models using PyTorch, and performing data analysis to derive actionable business insights. Additionally, I was involved in building web applications, optimizing performance with GPU-accelerated solutions, and managing large datasets using tools like PySpark and Dask. The project was heavily integrated with GCP and cloud-based tools like AWS for deployment and continuous integration.
